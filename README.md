# Multilinear-Polynomial-Extension-MLE
### Compute the Multilinear Polynomial Extension (MLE) of your function based on your inputs

## What is Multilinear Polynomial Extension (MLE) 

## How to Run
``python3 multilinearPolynomial.py``

## Examples

Consider function f:
  * f:{0,1}<sup>2</sup> -> F<sub>5</sub> is a function mapping {0,1}<sup>2</sup> to the field F<sub>5</sub> and f<sub>0</sub> = 1, f<sub>1</sub> = 2, f<sub>2</sub> = 1, f<sub>3</sub> = 3.

For computing the Multilinear Polynomial Extension of function f based on x<sub>1</sub> = 2 and x<sub>2</sub> = 3:

1. Please specify the group order: 5
2. Please enter your inputs, then type "end" when you're done: 1
3. Please enter your inputs, then type "end" when you're done: 2
4. Please enter your inputs, then type "end" when you're done: 1
5. Please enter your inputs, then type "end" when you're done: 4
6. Please enter your inputs, then type "end" when you're done: end
7. Your multilinear polynomial extension has 2 inputs
8. Please enter your inputs for your multilinear polynomial extension: 2
9. Please enter your inputs for your multilinear polynomial extension: 3
10. Final result:  16
11. 16 mod 5 =  1
